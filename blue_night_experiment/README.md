## Blue Night experiemnt

This is an experiment to test growing tomatoes (Tiny Tim dwarf) using blue light for the night cycle. This means that both plants will get no IR light at night, simulating nighttime, but the plant growing with the 'blue_night' version will recieve extra engery during that 12 hour period.

The first grow with this set up was performed in 3 v4 PFC devices. 
- 'Hidden Snow' was set up as a control, just one tomato plant, 12 hours of summer sun, 12 hours of dark
- 'Aged Shape' was set up with the same environment as the control, but with 3 basil plants also in the chamber. This was done to see how the plant grew differently when accompanied with the basil.
- 'Blue Water' was set up with a single tomato plant like the control but with 12 hours of summer sun, and then 12 hours of blue light rather than dark.

The grow began January 2nd, 2020.
This was done on 3 development machines I had. These machines were very close to the final version v4, with only minor differences in the chassies from what will become the release version. All the windows were covered with white cardboard to isolate the lighting conditions. Water levels were checked almost daily, and topped off with either tap water, or a hydroponic solution. (General Hydroponics fertilizer mixed in accordance to the directions.)

The software was kept stable on the machines during the grow.

There was a slight issue where the seedlings were initally confused, so all 3 tomato plants were grown under the dark night conditions for the first two days, and one of the basil plants was in the blue night box for those same two days. Once my mistake was caught, the plants were then transplanted into the correct boxes. (This shouldn't affect results very much.)

I'll post data here after the grow has completed. The images are, unfortunatly, rather blury but this might be a good opportunity to try out some de-bluring deep learned models.
